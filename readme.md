## JetBrains ReSharper Annotations

ReSharper Annotations help reduce false positive warnings, explicitly declare purity and nullability in your code, deal with implicit usages of types and members, support special semantics of the APIs in ASP.NET and XAML frameworks and otherwise increase the accuracy of the code inspections in JetBrains .NET IDEs.
